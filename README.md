# Short little introduction

Hi I'm Zack! A 15 y/o computer nerd who took up programming as a hobby out of boredom.

I do not use github often for public repos anymore, more as backup storage. You can still find my stuff on my GitHub page though.

I do Roblox Game Moderation on the side. (if you want to hire me for some reason click [here](https://talent.roblox.com/creators/191641041))

I make Roblox games on the side occasionally (you can find some of my assets [here](https://github.com/Apraxed/ApraxRobloxModules)
